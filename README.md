# cpp-skill-retention

## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to helping me retain and refresh my C++ skills. I created it as a structured practice space to work on fundamental C++ concepts, solve generated tasks, and build projects that demonstrate key programming techniques. The tasks within this repository were generated by chatGPT, designed to cover a wide range of essential C++ features, ensuring I maintain proficiency in object-oriented programming, memory management, polymorphism, and more. 

Each task focuses on a different concept or set of concepts, allowing me to reinforce my understanding through hands-on coding. This project will be an evolving space where I continue to add new challenges and their corresponding solutions.

## TASK 1: Virtual Library Management System

### Objective:
Develop a C++ program to manage a virtual library system, where different types of users (students and professors) can borrow books. The system will track the availability of books, issue and return operations, and due dates.

### Requirements:

#### Encapsulation:
- Use access specifiers (private, public, protected) to protect the data and provide controlled access through member functions.

#### Classes and Objects:
- Create a `Book` class that holds attributes such as title, author, ISBN, availability, and due date.
- Create a `User` abstract class with common attributes like name, ID, and virtual methods for borrowing books.

#### Inheritance:
- Derive `Student` and `Professor` classes from the `User` class, with different borrowing limits (students: up to 5 books, professors: up to 10 books).

#### Polymorphism:
- **Compile-Time Polymorphism**: Implement function overloading (e.g., constructors of the `Book` class or a method to search books by title or ISBN).
- **Run-Time Polymorphism**: Implement virtual functions in the `User` class for borrowing books, and override them in the `Student` and `Professor` classes.

#### Abstraction:
- Use the abstract `User` class to represent different types of users, with `borrowBook()` implemented uniquely for students and professors.

#### Additional Features:
- Implement a menu for users to:
  - View available books.
  - Borrow a book (if available).
  - Return a book (mark it as available again).
  - View a list of all borrowed books.

#### Optional (Bonus Feature):
- Implement penalties for late returns, allowing users to view their penalties based on how overdue their return is.

## TASK 2: Sudoku Solver

### Objective:
Develop a C++ program that implements a Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm. The program should read Sudoku puzzles from a predefined set or ones inputed by user, solve them, and display the solution. 

### Requirements:

#### Recursion:
- Use recursive algorythm like backtracking.

#### Display:
- Allow for customizable display settings (e.g., step delay).
- Display a step-by-step solution of the puzzle.

#### Constrains:
- Focus on a clear and efficient implementation without using classes.
- Validate Sudoku grids.
